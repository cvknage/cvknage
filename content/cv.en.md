## Resumé
I currently work as a Software Developer on a Scrum Team dedicated to the digitalisation of insurance sales at Alka Forsikring.

Apart from recent experience in languages such as C# and a full Vue.js JavaScript web stack, I have worked as an Agile Coach on a large scale SAFe implementation and have several years as a scrum master under my belt.

As a person I am open for new inputs. I function well in a group, but am also capable of working effectively on my own. I am responsible and a fast learner. I am not afraid to take on a challenge.

My dream is to use technology to build products that help people and improve quality of life.
