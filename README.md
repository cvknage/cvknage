# Website

This is the repository for the knage.net website.

It is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and is currently hosted on Github pages available at https://knage.net.
The theme and setup is forked from the [Asahi Linux](https://github.com/AsahiLinux/AsahiLinux.github.io) website - because it looks slick, containc no JavaScript and this is my first dance with Hugo.

## Getting Started

In order to build this site, you first need to clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cvknage/cvknage.git
```

Next, make sure you have Hugo installed. The best way to do that will depend on your platform, so check their [documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

Once everything is installed, move to the directory where this repository is cloned and run the following commands to start a development server

```bash
cd cvknage
hugo server
```

You will then have a web server running at http://localhost:1313.
